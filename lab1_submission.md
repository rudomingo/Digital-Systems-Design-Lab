# Laboratory Exercise 1 Submission
Student Name 1: Ron Domingo (rdomingo)

Student Name 2: Michael Lu (mingci7)

## Part 1
Please attach your modified app in the \`\`\`scala session.
Your answer:
```scala
// Copy-paste your implementation here
```

### Part 2
* Simulate the app using Scala and VCS simulation. Report on the simulation result. 

* Synthesize the design and run on the FPGA. Report the number of cycles needed for the design. 

* Report the resource utilization of your design. 


### Part 3
* Reimplement the example in Part 2 using FIFO / FILO. You can leave your implementation under Lab1Part4FIFOExample and Lab1Part5FILOExample. 
Your implementation: 
```scala
// Copy-paste your implementation here
```

* Run Scala simulation and VCS simulation. Report the results of VCS simulation.

* Synthesize the design and run it on the board. Report the number of cycles for running the design. 

* Check the utilization report. Report the resource utilization of your design.


### Part 4
* Use Fold controller to calculate the sum of an element. You can leave your implementation in Lab1Part7FoldExample.  
Your implementation
```scala
// Copy-paste your implementation here
```

### Part 5
* Please tell us what works and what doesn't for this lab:
